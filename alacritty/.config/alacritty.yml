# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it

# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  #TERM: alacritty

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)
  #
  # Number of lines/columns (not pixels) in the terminal. Both lines and columns
  # must be non-zero for this to take effect. The number of columns must be at
  # least `2`, while using a value of `0` for columns and lines will fall back
  # to the window manager's recommended size
  #dimensions:
  #  columns: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.

  # auto pick-up. Set this to `None` to use the default theme variant.
  #decorations_theme_variant: None

  # Resize increments
  #
  # Prefer resizing window by discrete steps equal to cell dimensions.
  #resize_increments: false

  # Make `Option` key behave as `Alt` (macOS only):
  #   - OnlyLeft
  #   - OnlyRight
  #   - Both
  #   - None (default)
